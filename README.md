- 👋 Hi, I’m @DocPfleg
- 👀 I’m interested in all things infosec and cybersecurity, but especially ethical-hacking and red-teaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and Azure, practicing new skills on TryHackMe, getting my Splunk certification, and getting more familiar with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to the things I've mentioned!
- 📫 You can reach me via e-mail at DanPfleging@protonmail.com, or via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpfleging/
